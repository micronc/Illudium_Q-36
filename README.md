# Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator Intelligence Briefing Generator

A Python tool that transforms raw threat intelligence — CVEs, IOC dumps, threat reports — into structured executive briefings using the Anthropic Claude API.

Built by Me... as a practical demonstration of Claude API integration for enterprise security workflows.

---

## What It Does

Give you the text that you need for executive briefings. 

Paste any raw threat intel and receive a structured briefing covering:

- **Threat Actor / Attribution** — who is behind it and confidence level
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** — relevant tactics and techniques with IDs
- **COMING SOON** - Alignment with MITRE ATLAS
- **Recommended Remediation Steps** — prioritized, actionable, immediate actions first
- **Executive Summary** — two to three sentences for leadership consumption

Output is saved as a timestamped Markdown file in a `briefings/` folder.

---
## What It Does NOT Do
- **Your taxes**
- **Tell you what in your network is impacted.** - The assumption is that you know what this connects to and are not trying to leak that to the world.

---

## Why This Matters for Enterprise

This pattern — raw data in, structured intelligence out — is one of the most common Claude integration requests from enterprise security teams. It demonstrates:

- How to use Claude as an analytical layer on top of existing data feeds
- Prompt engineering for consistent, structured output
- A simple architecture that can be extended to ingest from SIEM APIs, threat feeds, or ticketing systems

---

## Setup

**Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- An Anthropic API key (get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

For HashiCorp Vault support (recommended for production):

```bash
pip install hvac
```

---

**Option 1: .env file (local development)**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```
- Put your API Key behing the = It annoys me that I have to highlight that "place_key_here" text so I didn't put it here.


**Never** commit this file `.env.example` to Github. I've included for reference.

This means, put the .env.example (the example name is replaced with whatever you call you .env file, if you don't just leave it as .env) in the git.ignore file.
These added instructions are not for people that are using Github frequently. These notes are for the person just starting. 


---

**Option 2: HashiCorp Vault (enterprise / production)**

This is the recommended pattern for any team environment. Vault centralises secrets management, enforces access policies, and provides a full audit trail — no API keys sitting in files on developer machines.

Store your Anthropic API key in Vault:

```bash
vault kv put secret/anthropic/api_key value=""
# Put your key in between the double quotes. I didn't put a space there because then you'd have to highlight and that's annoying.
```

Set the following environment variables before running:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=https://your-vault-instance:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=
export USE_VAULT=true
# 1. I left the "VAULT_ADDR=" the way it is because you may be in an enterprise and localhost or 127.0.0.1 is not going to work.
# --- again... this is a note for the people just starting.
# As stated before please place your token, and vault details after the double quotes.
```

The script authenticates to Vault, retrieves the key at runtime, and never writes it to disk.

---

## Usage

```bash
python illuduimQ64.py
```

Paste your raw threat intelligence when prompted, then type `END` on a new line to submit.

**Example input:**

```
CVE-2024-1234: Remote code execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x
Observed IOCs: 185.234.xx.xx, hash: a1b2c3d4...
TTPs observed: spearphishing, lateral movement via SMB, credential dumping
Attribution: suspected APT29 based on tooling overlap
```

**Example output file:** `briefings/briefing_20250223_143022.md`

## Extending This
What is being suggested below is not a quick thing to do. It's not 100% required either. If you'd like a nice little frontend this is a fun side quest.

Some next steps for enterprise deployment:
- Connect input to a SIEM API (Splunk, Elastic) to pull alerts automatically
- Add a web front end using Flask
- Integrate with a ticketing system to auto-create incidents
- Add a vector database to compare new threats against historical briefings (RAG pattern)

## Author

Built this to demonstrate practical Claude API integration for enterprise security use cases, maybe. The reality is that it's a thrown together thing that needs you to commit your tokens, and API keys. I'm not responsible for your actions, environment, or emotional well-being. Use this as a thing you want to tinker with because you're bored, not because you're looking to "save the cheerleader."  

Direct from me to you:
I do not intend to sound snarky in the comments above. I am hoping that you can read that with a bit of humor because it's meant to be light hearted. 
I know how many assumptions can be made and while I was learning those assumptions really messed me up. I put those notes in place to actually be a little human.
If you don't get it right away, that's okay, just use Claude, or better yet, use Claude Code -- you will need to have a paid account though. When you do that you'll
see that they do something different. No API key exchange, just authentication through your existing account. That's actually a bit more.... a lot more efficient, but they 
are serving a public user. This is for making a little more sense of your threats. If you never use it at least you now have a different skill and a new thing to say you
built! :)
